[Simulation study 1](https://github.com/GajaNen/Thesis/blob/main/Simulation%201/): effect of predictor correlation, percentage of relevant variables, class imbalance and missingness mechanism on feature selection in artificial data

-   all information abot varying condtions is in [setup file](https://github.com/GajaNen/Thesis/blob/main/Simulation%201/setup.R)
-   [code with functions of data generating and fitting algorithms](https://github.com/GajaNen/Thesis/tree/main/Simulation%201/getOutput)
-   [code to run sim from start to end](https://github.com/GajaNen/Thesis/blob/main/Simulation%201/runSim.R)

[Simulation study 2](https://github.com/GajaNen/Thesis/blob/main/Simulation%202/): effect of missingness percentage, strength of missingness mechanism and type of missingness mechanism on feature selection in real predictors & simulated outcome
